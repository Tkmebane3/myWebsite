*Ongoing project* 
This is my personal website, built from the ground up using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.  
The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of front-end fundamentals while maintaining a clear development history as I progress toward more advanced frameworks like React. 
This site is in continuous development and will evolve over time as I add new features and improve the UI/UX.
Feel free to explore the code and follow the commit history to see how the project evolves.
